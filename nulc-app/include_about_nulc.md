## Nominal Unit Labour Cost ([NULC](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/tipslm10_esms.htm))

#### Definition
The unit labour cost (`ULC`) measures the average cost of labour per unit of output. 

#### Calculation
It is calculated as the ratio of `labour costs` to `labour productivity`. The `ULC` represents a link between productivity and the cost of labour in producing output.

#### Input data
The input data are obtained through official transmissions of national accounts' country data in the European system of accounts - ESA2010 - transmission programme.

#### Equation
Nominal ULC (NULC) is calculated as: (__D1__ / __EEM__) / (__B1GM__ / __ETO__), where:

 __D1__ = Compensation of employees, all industries, in current prices 

 __EEM__ = Employees, all industries, in persons (following the domestic concept)

 __B1GM__ = Gross domestic product at market prices in millions, chain-linked volumes reference year 2010

 __ETO__ = Total employment, all industries, in persons (following the domestic concept).

#### Intepretation

_A rise in an economys unit labour costs represents an increased reward for labours contribution to output. However, a rise in labour costs higher than the rise in labour productivity may be a threat to an economy's cost competitiveness, if other costs are not adjusted in compensation._

ULCs should not be interpreted as a comprehensive measure of competitiveness, but as a reflection of cost competitiveness. Unit labour cost measures deal exclusively with the cost of labour, which though important, should also be considered in relation to changes in the cost of capital, especially in advanced economies.
